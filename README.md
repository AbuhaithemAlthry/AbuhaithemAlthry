### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Seid Muhammed
I'm Seid from Ethiopia, and Iâ€™m currently learning at ALX cohort 8 and enrolled at Microverse for october 24, 2022. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React and React Native, as well as work in WordPress. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general. Not only that but also I am interested in android application development with  flutter.
